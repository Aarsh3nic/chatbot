# Simple Python Chat Bot with PyQt6

This is a simple Python program that uses the PyQt6 library to create a graphical user interface and an API to act as a chat bot. The program allows users to type in text and sends it to an API, which returns a response that is displayed in the program. The program can be used to interact with various APIs such as chatbots, language translation services, and more.

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- PyQt6 library installed on your system
- API credentials (if required by the API you are using) 

## Usage

To use this program, simply run the `main.py` script using Python. The program will open a graphical user interface that allows you to enter text to send to the API. The API response will be displayed in the program.

## Configuration

To configure the program, you will need to modify the `backend.py` script to use the API of your choice. Replace the API endpoint and credentials with those of your chosen API.
